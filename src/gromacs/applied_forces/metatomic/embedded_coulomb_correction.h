 * \brief
 * Removes the classical Coulomb interaction between embedded (Metatomic) atoms
 * at every distance.
 *
 * With metatomic-oniom, all embedded atoms are mutually excluded, which is how
 * E_MM(embedded) is subtracted. The non-bonded kernels only treat excluded
 * pairs within rcoulomb:
 *
 * - Ewald/PME: the reciprocal sum contains every pair, and the kernels remove
 *   it with -q_i q_j erf(beta r)/r for r < rcoulomb only. Pairs beyond
 *   rcoulomb keep their full MM interaction, and the energy jumps when a pair
 *   crosses the cut-off. The correction is -q_i q_j erf(beta r)/r for
 *   r >= rcoulomb.
 * - Reaction-field and plain cut-off: the kernels leave
 *   q_i q_j (k_rf r^2 - c_rf) on excluded pairs within rcoulomb, which jumps to
 *   zero at the cut-off. The correction cancels it for r < rcoulomb.
 *
 * In both cases the MM Coulomb energy between embedded atoms is zero at all
 * distances, apart from the constant reaction-field self term.
