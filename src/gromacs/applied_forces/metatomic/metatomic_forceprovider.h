/*! \brief \internal
 * MetatomicForceProvider class
 *
 * Implements the IForceProvider interface for the Metatomic force provider.
 *
 * ## Domain decomposition (DD) strategy
 *
 * Each rank evaluates the model on its local (home + halo) MTA atoms.
 * The GROMACS plain pairlist (interacting pairs plus exclusions) serves as the pair source; a backward ghost
 * atom exchange followed by a backward pair exchange ensures every home atom
 * has ALL its pairs (the "newton pair ON" pattern from LAMMPS pair_metatomic).
 * Distance vectors and shifts are recomputed from local positions.
 * The energy is summed over home atoms only (`selected_atoms = home_only`).
 * This approach is safe for all model architectures.
 *
 * **Atoms**: In DD, GROMACS partitions atoms into "home" atoms (owned by
 * this rank) and "halo" atoms (copies from neighboring ranks needed for
 * short-range interactions). The same global atom may appear as multiple
 * periodic ghost images in the halo. We deduplicate these so each atom has
 * one model index, but record ALL GROMACS local buffer indices in
 * gmxLocalToMtaIdx_ so that the pairlist (which may reference any image) can
 * be resolved.
 *
 * **Forces**: `execute_model` returns an explicit positions gradient (values
 * are -F) on every local atom the model saw (home + halo). There is no
 * autograd here. Since ForceWithVirial is not communicated by dd_move_f,
 * home forces are applied directly and non-home (halo) forces are exchanged
 * via sparse indexed communication (allgatherv pattern). Falls back to dense
 * allreduce for small systems (N_total_mta < 1000).
 *
 * ## ONIOM link caps
 *
 * With `metatomic-oniom`, every ML/MM bond cut by the model region gets a
 * hydrogen cap on the embedded-to-MM bond, at `linkDistance` from the
 * embedded atom. The first cap on a boundary MM atom replaces that atom's
 * row in the model input; further caps on the same MM atom get extra rows
 * after the local atoms. Pairs involving cap rows are rebuilt from the cap
 * positions (minimum image), since the GROMACS pairlist only knows the MM
 * atom. The cap force is spread onto the embedded and MM atoms with the
 * exact chain rule (`spreadLinkAtomForce`), and the virial gets the matching
 * correction for the cap's fixed bond length.
 *
 * **Shift convention**: GROMACS shifts atom I (first):
 * d = x[I]+shift - x[J]. Metatensor convention: r_ij = x[J] + cell_shift*box
 * - x[I]. Therefore metatensor cell shifts = negated GROMACS cell shifts.
 * Backward pairs have shifts recomputed from local positions using the
 * minimum-image convention.

     * In GROMACS DD, the plain pairlist assigns each pair to exactly one

     * rank needs ALL pairs involving its home atoms, including those assigned
     * to other ranks. This method discovers those missing pairs by
     * circulating packed (globalI, globalJ) pair buffers in P-1 ring rounds,

     * positions. Complexity: O(total_pairs) communication, O(max_pairs/rank)
     * memory — replaces the previous O(N²) pair table allreduce.

    /*! \brief Exchange backward ghost MTA atoms via DD to fill the backward gap.
     *
     * In the standard GROMACS DD halo exchange, atoms are communicated
     * via forward pulses only.  When the number of forward pulses does
     * not cover all cells in a dimension (npulse < numCells - 1), atoms
     * from the backward PBC neighbor are missing from the local halo.
     * This method performs one additional forward exchange per DD dimension
     * to fill this gap.
     *
     * Protocol: each rank identifies home MTA atoms within \p cutoff of its
     * forward cell boundary, then calls \c ddSendrecv(dd, d, dddirForward).
     * The receiving rank gets atoms from its backward neighbor.  Received
     * positions are PBC-shifted when the backward neighbor wraps around.
     *
     * Called once per step from \c calculateForces(), after
     * \c gatherAtomPositions() and before \c exchangeBackwardPairs().
     * Extends positions_, atomNumbers_, mtaToGlobalMta_, and numLocalMta_
     * with the backward ghost atoms.  The caller must save and restore the
     * original numLocalMta_ after model evaluation.
     *
     * \param[in] dd      Domain decomposition structure.
     * \param[in] box     Current simulation box.
     * \param[in] cutoff  Maximum model cutoff (nm).
     * \returns Number of backward ghost atoms added.
